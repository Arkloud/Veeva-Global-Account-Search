The Global Account Search Tool (Visual Force/Apex) allows sales representatives to search across all Accounts (Healthcare providers, Hospitals, etc) that have been loaded into Veeva CRM.  Searches may be done using various criteria and when an Account has been found, the sales representatives may add it to his or her territory.
